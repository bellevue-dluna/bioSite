                <p>When asked if his life were a book and he could skip to the last chapter and 
                    read it would he? My father replied he would not he says that what he experiences 
                    every day makes him who he isn't it has nothing to do with the last chapter of his book. 
                    He is his truest self at this moment and when the end comes he will still be the 
                    amazing caring human he is today and to him that's all that matters.</p>

                <h2>Tucker Act</h2>
                <br>

                <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">After his son was murdered by the mother's boyfriend, after the years my father font to
                     get us out of that house the money spent the lawyers, he decided that he was never going to 
                     let this happen to another person again. It took him three years after my brother died to 
                     pass the Tucker Act. this act states that Child Protective Services must perform surprise 
                     visits rather than scheduling it with the accused abuser as they had been before. This was 
                     to prevent the abuser from coaching the family ahead of time. And also that the parent did 
                     not have to be present like it was before but instead could be a school counselor. In the 
                     year following the Tucker act deaths in cases resulting in child abuse went from 32 to 8 in the state of Kentucky 
                    and they continued to decline and remain low thanks to my brother and my father. You may click on the image for more infomation. </p>

                    <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">One of my father's other achievements is his ability to build a deer stand in the woods that should 
                        require a permit because it is basically a house. As you can see in the image hits deer stand has a 
                        front door , landing so that he can shoot off of them, windows that open and close, an air conditioning unit,
                         and even a garage for his four wheeler. I'm not sure where you grew up or if this is impressive to you but 
                         this is pretty freaking awesome and I assert that it should be included in his will.</p>

                    <h2 style="word-wrap: break-word; padding-top: 20px;">We are Family</h2>
                    <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">My father says the most appealing thing that he does is helping others. 
                        He wants to keep other families together he wants to build a safe community. He intends this to be his 
                        legacy. My father is the oldest person to graduate the Kentucky police Academy at the age of 44. Because 
                        he's always wanted to do it and he got out of the rut he was in and decided to go for it. He started out 
                        as a DARE officer at the school in which he was able to impact children's lives everyday. He is often quoted 
                        as saying we are family and I will still here “his kids” use that catch phrase when we're in public. He was 
                        elected sheriff only four years ago beating out the incumbent sheriff of 21 years. He wanted things to change
                         and he took it upon himself to change it and that quality is something that I will cherish as he is passed on to me.</p>
