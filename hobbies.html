                <br><h2 style="word-wrap: break-word;">Non-Profit Org</h2>
                <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">After the death of his son by homicide, Phillip founded a nonprofit 
                    organization called One Tucker At A Time for which he remains the president. 
                    To date he has passed laws, held awareness events, and is currently working on building a 
                    safe place for kids to go after school with volunteers so that they don't have to return 
                    home if they don't feel comfortable. </p>
                <br><br><figure class="hobby-img" >
                    <img src="img/hunter.png" style="height: 320px; width: 240px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">

                <h2 style="word-wrap: break-word;">Hunting and Fishing</h2>
                <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">In his free time he hunts like he used too with his son. He spends most of the year 
                    preparing for the hunt by getting licenses cleaning his weapon, and building his deer stand. 
                    He will even scope out the best spots set up salt licks and corn earlier in the year to
                     try and change the deers habits so that he might have better luck. One of my favorite 
                     memories as a child was always having deer in the freezer during the winter.</p>

                <h2 style="word-wrap: break-word;">The Sherriff Never Sleeps</h2>
                <figure class="hobby-img">
                    <img src="img/badge.jpg" style= "float: right; margin-left: 20px;" >
                </figure>
                <p style="word-wrap: break-word;"> Now I know what you're thinking: Being the sheriff is not a hobby. Somehow my father's 
                    work ethic makes that untrue. He has his radio on him at all times he is the sheriff 
                    he is not just fill in the office. The people call him and he will always be there for 
                    them period now it's one of the things that I love about him. We will have people show
                     up at all times of night fearing for their safety and our home is a safe haven. So it 
                     may not seem like a hobby. But my father never turns it off.</p>
